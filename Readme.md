# Plotter

### Purpose
The purpose of this branch is to plot (SSE vs K) and (Time taken vs K) plots from the data that was collected from CMLBDA.
(K is the no. of clusters)

### Steps
        1. Create a data folder at root
        2. Add all the output.txt files to this newly created data folder
        3. To change the max value of K plotted, uncomment line no. 54 in driver.py but this is not compulsory at all
        4. Install dependencies from 'requirements.txt'
        5. Run the file 'driver.py'

### Outcomes

The optimal value of K can be found out using the elbow method. You can refer to elbow method in this [Medium Article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/elbow-method-of-k-means-clustering-algorithm-a0c916adc540) and this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)) article.
